# Apple Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This repository contains a project aimed at predicting Apple Inc.'s stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The model is trained on historical stock price data and optimized using the Adam optimizer. The performance of the model is evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function.

## Project Overview

Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the volatile nature of financial markets. LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequence prediction problems, making them an excellent choice for this task. In this project, we use an LSTM network to forecast the future stock prices of Apple Inc.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed to normalize the stock prices and prepare the data for training.
- **LSTM Model**: A multi-layer LSTM network is implemented to capture the temporal dependencies in the stock price data.
- **Adam Optimizer**: The model is trained using the Adam optimizer, known for its efficiency and effectiveness in training deep learning models.
- **Loss Function**: The Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function is used to evaluate the model's performance, minimizing the error between the predicted and actual stock prices.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python and the following libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   
2. **Prepare the data**:
    - Ensure you have the historical stock price data for Apple Inc. (e.g., from Yahoo Finance). or use api like used in this project from FMP

3. **Train the model**:
    - Run the  script to train the LSTM model:
     
4. **Evaluate the model**:
    - The MSE loss will be calculated and displayed after training. You can also visualize the predicted vs. actual stock prices using the provided plotting function.

## Results

The model's predictions can be visualized to compare against the actual stock prices. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss metric provides a quantitative measure of the model's accuracy.

## Future Work

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different hyperparameters, such as the number of LSTM layers, neurons, and learning rate.
- **Feature Engineering**: Incorporate additional features such as technical indicators, sentiment analysis, or macroeconomic data to improve predictions.
- **Model Optimization**: Explore other deep learning models and optimization techniques for better performance.
